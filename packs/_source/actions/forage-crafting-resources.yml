      <p><strong>Requirements</strong> trained in Survival</p>

      <p>You try to find crafting materials for your trove in your environment.
      The GM assigns a task level representing the most promising foraging
      location nearby. You can search for lower-level locations, with the GM
      determining whether you find any. When you begin to forage for resources,
      the GM secretly sets the DC. After your first day of foraging, you roll a
      @Check[type:survival|traits:action:forage] check to determine your
      findings.</p>

      <p><strong>Success </strong>Add the amount listed on
      @Compendium[heroic-crafting.tables.sRUtd8SA7a47dGA8]{Table 2: Gathered
      Income} for the location's level to your Material Trove each day. If you
      are a master in Survival, instead add twice as much.</p>

      <p><strong>Failure</strong>You find no materials.</p>

      <p>You can continue foraging in a location on subsequent days without
      rolling again until the GM determines that there are no more resources
      available, typically after a week or two.</p>
