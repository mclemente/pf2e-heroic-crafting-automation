      <p><strong>Requirements</strong> trained in Crafting</p>

      <p><strong>Cost</strong> the item to be salvaged</p>

      <p>You tear down an item for parts. The GM decides if the item can be
      salvaged this way. Roll a @Check[type:crafting|traits:action:salvage]
      check against the item's Craft DC.</p>

      <p><strong>Success</strong> Add the amount listed on
      @Compendium[heroic-crafting.tables.sRUtd8SA7a47dGA8]{Table 2: Gathered
      Income} for your level to your Material Trove each hour. If you are a
      master in Crafting, instead add twice as much. The item becomes
      unusable.</p>

      <p><strong>Failure</strong> Add half the amount listed on Table 2:
      Gathered Income for your level to your Material Trove each hour. If you
      are a master in Crafting, instead add the listed amount. The item becomes
      unusable.</p>

      <p>You can continue salvaging an item for multiple hours without rolling
      again until you have recovered the item's Salvage Maximum, after which the
      item is destroyed. The GM determines the item's Salvage Maximum, but it is
      never greater than 75% of the item's Price, and is typically 50% or lower
      based on the item's condition.</p>

      <p>At the GM's discretion, you may sometimes be able to salvage special
      materials or treasure worth the same amount instead.</p>
