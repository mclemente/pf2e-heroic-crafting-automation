      <p><strong>Requirements</strong> trained in Crafting; you have
      @Compendium[heroic-crafting.actions.ULKxHUhxSoAKa9eD]{Begun a Project} and
      have not yet finished it; you are not
      @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued}; you have appropriate
      tools and in many cases a work space.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost</strong> crafting materials worth up to the amount listed
      in @Compendium[heroic-crafting.tables.EDZW2vtmpGZUqUrk]{Table 1: Spending
      Limit}</p>

      <p>Choose the amount of time to spend crafting: 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week.
      The time spent, along with your level, determines the maximum Cost of this
      activity.</p>

      <p>At the end of the duration, decide the Cost of this activity, then make
      a @Check[type:crafting|traits:action:craftproj|name:{itemName}] check. The
      GM determines the DC based on the item's level, rarity, and any other
      circumstances.</p>

      <p><strong>Success</strong> You work productively during this period. Add
      double this activity's Cost to the project's Current Value.</p>

      <p><strong>Failure</strong> You work unproductively during this period.
      Add half this activity's Cost to the project's Current Value.</p>

      <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You ruin your materials and suffer a
      setback while crafting. Deduct this activity's Cost from the project's
      Current Value. If this reduces the project's Current Value below 0, the
      project is ruined and must be started again.</p>

      <p>If the difference between your project's Current Value and its Price is
      less than this activity's maximum Cost, you can forgo the Crafting check.
      Instead, at the end of the duration you may simply pay the remaining value
      to complete the project.</p>
