      <p><strong>Requirements</strong> trained in Crafting; you have the formula
      and the prerequisite feats for the item; you have the appropriate
      proficiency to craft the item.</p>

      <p>To begin a crafting project, write down the name of the item you're
      crafting and its total Price. Spend crafting materials worth up to half
      the item's Price, and write down that value. This is the project's Current
      Value, and it will increase as you complete Crafting checks. When the
      Current Value equals the item's Price, the project is complete. The GM
      determines the duration of this activity.</p>
