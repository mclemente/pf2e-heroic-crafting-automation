      <p><strong>Requirements</strong> trained in Crafting; you have the
      prerequisite feats for the item; you have the appropriate proficiency to
      craft the item.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost</strong> The item whose formula you want to
      reverse-engineer</p>

      <p>To begin a crafting project, write down the name of the item you're
      crafting and its total Price. Spend crafting materials worth up to half
      the item's Price, and write down that value. This is the project's Current
      Value, and it will increase as you complete Crafting checks. When the
      Current Value equals the item's Price, the project is complete. The GM
      determines the duration of this activity.</p>

      <p>This destroys the item, but leaves behind fragments which can be
      @Compendium[heroic-crafting.actions.GOpD2cXjEF1L7R68]{Salvaged} for 50% of
      the item's value</p>
