  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your time living off the land has taught you that with enough care,
      many useful items can be created from naturally-occurring materials. You
      can use your Survival modifier instead of your Crafting modifier on checks
      to @Compendium[heroic-crafting.actions.bvV60XkAwimfgtAu]{Craft A Project}.
      Additionally, you can use Survival in place of Crafting for the purposes
      of meeting the requirements to Begin or Craft a Project and to qualify for
      feats that fulfill crafting requirements, such as Alchemical Crafting and
      Magical Crafting.</p>
