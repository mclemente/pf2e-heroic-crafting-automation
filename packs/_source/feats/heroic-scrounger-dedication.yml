  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can craft items even without appropriate tools or a workshop,
      though you take a -2 item penalty to your Crafting check. Additionally,
      you don't need a physical formula book to remember all of your formulas;
      you pay the same cost as normal to learn them, but you memorize them
      all.</p>

      <p>You gain the Midnight Crafting skill feat, regardless of whether you
      meet its prerequisites. When you use it to craft a common, non-magical
      weapon, armor, or piece of nonconsumable adventuring gear of 1st level or
      lower, you can choose to create that item as a temporary item. Temporary
      items created in this way last only [[/r 1d4 #hours]]{1d4 hours} (the GM
      rolls secretly) before falling apart and becoming unusable, and other
      creatures treat them as shoddy items, but you can ignore the rush cost
      when crafting them. You can create only the physical item, not any
      information or magic, so for example, while you could create a blank
      journal or one of random pages, you couldn't use it as a scholarly journal
      or a religious text.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can use other items or materials you have on hand to
      pay for the costs of crafting an item with Midnight Crafting, without
      needing to Salvage them first. If you do so, you take a -5 penalty on the
      Crafting check (or a -10 penalty if the materials you used were
      particularly unsuitable, as determined by the GM).</p>

      <p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until
      you have gained two other feats from the Scrounger archetype. This feat
      counts as Scrounger Dedication.</p>
