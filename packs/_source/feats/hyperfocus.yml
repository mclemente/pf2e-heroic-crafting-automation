      <p>When inspiration strikes, you can progress further than should really
      be possible. When you roll a critical success on a check to
      @Compendium[heroic-crafting.actions.bvV60XkAwimfgtAu]{Craft A Project} for
      at least a day, your expertise in crafting allows you to make more
      progress than normal with the materials available.</p>

      <p>In addition to the progress you would make on a success, if you spent 1
      day crafting, add the value listed in
      @Compendium[heroic-crafting.tables.EDZW2vtmpGZUqUrk]{Table 1: Spending
      Limit} for 1 hour to your Current Value. If you spent 1 week crafting, add
      the value listed in Table 1: Spending Limit for 1 day to your Current
      Value. This feat cannot add more than the Cost of the Craft a Project
      activity to the item's Current Value.</p>
